# Comprehensive Sales Intelligence & Simulation for AdventureWorks

When we first opened the dataset, it wasn’t a spreadsheet — it was a storm.  
Thousands of records scattered across multiple tables, missing fields everywhere, and no clear direction. It looked chaotic. But hidden inside that chaos was a business story waiting to be told.

### 💡 Phase 1 – SQL Foundations  
Our journey began with SQL — the backbone of data exploration.  
We dove deep into the **AdventureWorks** database, joining fragmented tables, cleaning inconsistencies, and forming a **Snowflake schema** that connected sales, products, employees, and customers.  

This stage wasn’t just about fixing data; it was about *understanding the business pulse*.  
We asked bold questions:  
- What truly drives sales?  
- Who are the customers that matter most?  
- Which employees shape success?  

Through complex joins, aggregations, and calculated fields, we turned static tables into meaningful relationships — revealing patterns across **time, geography, and behavior**.

### 📊 Phase 2 – Power BI Modeling & Visualization  
Once the structure was ready, we shifted to **Power BI** to give life to our findings.  
Using **Power Query**, we standardized formats, filled gaps, and built a dynamic, interconnected data model.  
We crafted **DAX measures**, designed calculated columns, and introduced a **custom time table** to unlock advanced time-intelligence analysis — including year-over-year trends and seasonality insights.  

Then came the dashboards — designed not for decoration, but for storytelling.  
Each visual had a purpose, each page a question:  
- How do sales differ by region and product category?  
- Which customers drive profit — and which drain it?  
- What fuels growth and performance?  

The outcome: an interactive reporting ecosystem that turned complex numbers into a **strategic business narrative**.

### 🎯 Phase 3 – Simulation & Forecasting  
With the past understood, we looked ahead.  
Leveraging **Monte Carlo** and other **non-parametric simulation techniques**, we modeled four years of data (2011–2014) to forecast potential future scenarios.  

We simulated variations in **customer growth, revenue volatility, and spending behavior**, running thousands of “what-if” cases.  
This gave management a way to explore uncertainty, measure risk, and see the *probabilities behind possible futures* — going beyond traditional analytics.

### 📈 Key Insights  
The company — a global bicycle manufacturer — earned **$109.85M** in revenue across four years.  
Yet, with a **COGS ratio of 91.5%** and a **profit margin of only 8.53%**, profitability was a challenge.  

A small group of resellers (just **3.3% of all customers**) contributed most of the revenue, but heavy discounts slashed margins.  
We discovered a paradox: **the company was gaining customers but losing profitability.**  

Regional trends revealed more:  
During 2013–2014, when pricing strategy outweighed product quality, total sales rose — but the **average customer spend declined**, particularly in quality-sensitive regions like the **UK**.

### 👥 Salesperson Performance Analysis  
We went beyond numbers and looked at people.  
Demographic insights revealed that top-performing sales reps were typically **40–50 years old**, **married**, and took **20–30 vacation hours annually**.  
A fascinating takeaway: **balanced employees drive better results.**  

---

### 🧠 Advanced Data Techniques: Bootstrapping & Completion  
To fill missing quarterly data, we used **bootstrapping** with over **2000 iterations** — ensuring statistical consistency and realistic patterns.  
This method helped us overcome data gaps without distorting trends or introducing bias.

### ✨ Conclusion  
This project wasn’t just about dashboards, models, or forecasts — it was about **discovering truth through data**.  
Every visualization told a story. Every simulation uncovered a possibility.  

We didn’t just analyze the past — we **understood the business, simulated the future, and empowered smarter decisions**.  

Because in the end, **data means nothing until it drives real impact**.
